<h1>Amos Nyirenda Portfolio Project</h1>
<p>This project has been designed as part of my assignments while following the Full Stack Engineering Path at the Edureka Online Learning Platform. It is a static website purely relying on plain HTML, CSS and Javascript to show off the skills I have mastered so far in the program</p>

<p>I should have created this Portfolio as a single page but decided to create separate ABOUT and CONTACT pages to show that I am comfortable with both Single Page and Multi Page Applications.</p>

<h2>ToDo:</h2>
<ol type="a">
    <li>Need to remove the dots under the Social Media Icons. Not yet sure why they are currently appearing like that</li>
    <li>Find a better color scheme for the Header to make it abit more appealing to the eye.</li>
</ol>
